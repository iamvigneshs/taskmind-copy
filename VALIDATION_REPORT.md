### **4. API Gateway Orchestration**

#### **✅ Orchestrated Workflows**
- ✅ `POST /api/v2/workflows/tasks` - Complete task creation with assignment
- ✅ `GET /api/v2/workflows/tasks/{id}` - Aggregated task data from all services
- ✅ `POST /api/v2/workflows/assign` - Task assignment with notification
- ✅ `POST /api/v2/workflows/approve` - Approval with status updates
- ✅ `POST /api/v2/workflows/comment` - Comment creation and tracking
- ✅ `GET /api/v2/dashboard/{user_id}` - User dashboard aggregation

#### **✅ Direct Service APIs**
- ✅ `GET /api/v2/tasks/*` - Direct task service operations
- ✅ `GET /api/v2/assignments/*` - Direct assignment service operations
- ✅ `GET /api/v2/comments/*` - Direct comment service operations

## 🏗️ Architecture Characteristics Validated

### ✅ **Single Responsibility Principle**
- **Task Service**: Manages task lifecycle, priority scoring, and routing
- **Assignment Service**: Handles assignments, approvals, and workflow states
- **Comment Service**: Manages communication, notes, and status updates
- **API Gateway**: Orchestrates requests and provides unified interface

### ✅ **Database Per Service**
- Each microservice owns its data completely
- No direct database sharing between services
- Independent data models and schemas

### ✅ **Decentralized Data Management**
- Services synchronize data through API calls
- Event-driven updates via HTTP requests
- No shared transaction management

### ✅ **Independent Deployment and Scaling**
- Docker containers for each service
- Independent version management
- Scalable per service requirements

### ✅ **Fault Tolerance**
- Health checks on all services
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- Circuit breaker pattern in API Gateway

### ✅ **Technology Diversity**
- Common FastAPI/Python stack for consistency
- Each service can evolve independently
- Database schemas optimized per service
